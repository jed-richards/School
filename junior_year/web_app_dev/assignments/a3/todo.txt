Modify todo-list.html so that when items are created/loaded, they have a button
labeled 'X' next to them.  The button should remove the item from the TODO list
(both from the page and from the localStorage array).

Additionally, you should add a "Clear" button next to the "Add" button that 
clears the entire list.

You will once again work with your teams from A2.  Only one member of your team
needs to upload your HTML file
